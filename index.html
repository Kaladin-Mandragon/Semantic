        <h1>King Midas</h1>
        <article>
            <h2>Who Was He?</h2>
            <p>
                King Midas was a king that was favored by the gods and was given a wish 
                by them. He chose to be able to turn anything he touched into gold. 
                <strong>BAM!</strong> He touched a plate, it is now gold. <strong>BAM!</strong> 
                He touched a tree, now it is solid gold.</p>

            <h2>Why Was His Wish Foolish?</h2>
            <p>
                After enjoying turning his flowers and plates and silverware into solid 
                gold items, he called to his servants to bring him some food because he 
                was hungry. He was brought an apple on one of his new fancy golden plates. 
                He picked it up to take a bite. <strong>BAM!</strong> His teeth struck the 
                solid gold apple.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>
                His eyes grew larger as he began to panic. How would he be able to eat! 
                As fear began to set in, he heard the melodious sound of his daughter's 
                laughter as she entered the room. She ran up to him and said "Daddy, 
                come see what I can do outside!" </p>
            <p>
                Before he would warn her or pull his hand away she grabbed his hand and 
                turned to pull him out of his chair and take him outside. Before his very 
                eyes his beautiful daughter turned to gold. As he fell to the ground beside 
                her in grief, he noticed her face that was now etched from gold containing 
                a grin of childlike joy.

            <h3>Tips For Making A Wish</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Be <em>very</em> specific with wishes so that there are fewer ways that things 
                    could end badly
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make the effect only happen in certain circumstances to avoid accidental effects</li>
                        <li>Set limits upon the wish so that certain things are unable to happen</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Think of all possible situations in which your wish would be an issue 
                    and think of loopholes to avoid those situations</li>
                <li>Avoid wishes that may collapse the economy unless that is actually your 
                    final goal</li>
            </ol>
